# ðŸ“Š ML in Python Series â€” Linear Models: Regression and Classification

This repository demonstrates how **Linear Models** can be used for solving both **regression** and **binary classification** problems using Python and NumPy.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents

### 1. Linear Regression (Auto MPG Data)
- Load and clean the data
- Visualize displacement vs. MPG
- Solve linear regression using:
  - Closed-form solution (Normal Equation)
  - Cost minimization visualization
  - Gradient Descent (with and without normalization)
- Plot fitted line and error distributions
- Evaluate performance using RMSE

### 2. Linear Classification (Housing Data)
- Convert regression to binary classification (price > 23k â†’ class 1)
- Add bias term to features
- Solve using Linear Regression weights
- Compute accuracy
- Visualize predicted vs. true labels

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing only)

---

## âœ… Output Highlights
- Visualization of regression fit and classification boundaries
- RMSE for regression
- Accuracy score for classification
- Gradient descent convergence plot
